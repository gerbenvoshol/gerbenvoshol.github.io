title: Amino Acid Properties
---

Proteins and peptides are build from various amino acids, which are linked together by the ribosome during a process called translation. There are 22 proteinogenic amino acids out of which 20 are encoded by the standard genetic code. All amino acids have common elements, such as an amine group (N-terminal group in proteins), a carboxyl group (C-terminal group in proteins) and a side chain. The side chain can have various functional groups and gives each amino acid distinct physical properties that influence the final protein, it's structure and function. There are many groupings available, but in general these groupings are based in the side chain. [Here]({{ site.url }}/downloads/AminoAcidPropertiesA3.pdf) is one of these groupings that I found useful and wanted to share with you.

As you might have notice, glycine is indicated twice in the venn diagram. This is not a mistake, but because glycine is a little bit strange. In general glycine is considered to be a hydrophobic amino acids. Hydrophobic amino acids are usually located inside a protein, but glycine is actually found mainly on the outside (solvent exposed) of an helix. Moreover, it doesn't really have a side chain. Therefore it is also placed outside of the hydrophobic group in the diagram. Another strange amino acid is proline, which is found often in the loops of proteins where it helps in maintaining a certain fold. Because glysine and proline play such a unique role in protein structure, they are often conserved within protein families. In general, amino acids within the same group are more often subsituted for eachother and the amount of set boundaries that you have to cross to get from one amino acid to another is inversely correlated with the likelyhood of such an substitution occurring.
