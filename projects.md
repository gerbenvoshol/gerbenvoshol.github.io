### Hidden Markov Model

Single header file implementation of a discrete Hidden Markov Model (HMM) in C. The file includes basic HMM functions such as the forward, backward, Viterbi and Baum-Welch algorithm. In the near future, I hope to write a short tutorial about using HMMs in the field of biology.
