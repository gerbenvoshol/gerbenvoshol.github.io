My name is Gerben (Dutch name originating from old Germanic and means something like "Spear Bear"). I am a molecular microbiologist biologist with experience in biotechnology, genetic engineering and bioinformatics. A long time ago, I started programming as a hobby and found it extrmely useful while working at the Institute of Biology at Leiden University. Through this webpage and blog I hope that I will be able to share my two passions, Biology and Programming. Want to know more about me, see my CV [here]({{ site.url }}/Downloads/Curriculum_Vitae_Gerben_Voshol.pdf)
