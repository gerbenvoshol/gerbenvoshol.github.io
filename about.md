My name is Gerben (Dutch name originating from old Germanic and means something like "Spear Bear"). I am a molecular microbiologist working within the field of biotechnology, genetic engineering and bioinformatics. A long time ago, I started programming as a hobby and found it extremely useful while doing my PhD and PostDoc at the Institute of Biology Leiden at Leiden University. Through this webpage and blog I hope that I will be able to share with you two of my passions - Biology and Programming. If you have any questions, feel free to write me a message (see email below).
