Here are some of the project I have worked on and that I hope I can share with you in the near future.

### Hidden Markov Model

Single header file implementation of a discrete Hidden Markov Model (HMM) in C. The file includes basic HMM functions such as the forward, backward, Viterbi and Baum-Welch algorithm. In the near future, I hope to write a short tutorial about using HMMs in the field of biology.

### Statistics Tool Box

Single header file with a bunch of useful statistical functions in C. Sometimes you need to do some simple statistics and you don't want to include a big library such as the GNU Scientific Library. Functions implemented include:
* T-Test
* Anova
* k-Sample Anderson Darling
* Chisqr (and G-Test)
* Liniear, Exponential, Polynomial curve fitting
* A very simple histogram
* and several more functions
